Low-Cost intelligent ECG.

This is the work created during the final project by student Alexander Mariel in the Facultad de Informática de San Sebastián.

From the abstract of the documentation:
Throughout this project a low-cost system has been developed for electrocardiogram reading and visualization in an Android app. An artificial intelligence module was also created to generate an automated and reasoned diagnostic on the received data. The project has been developed around open source technologies: Arduino as the base for the electronic system, Android to access the information on a portable device and CLIPS as the engine for the expert system which generates the diagnostic.
